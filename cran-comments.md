## Test environments
* Local Ubuntu 18.04 install, R 3.6.1
* Ubuntu 16.04 on travis-ci (devel and release)
* win-builder (devel and release)


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE, which is simply that the maintainer email changed (it's actually the same email, but I realized that I left out the period, which is how I prefer to write it, and this does not make a difference for gmail).


## revdepcheck results
There are no issues with the only current downstream dependency (Countr).
